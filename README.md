Some italian-written lecture notes on Quantum Mechanics

These notes are based on a two-semesters course on Quantum Mechanics at the University of Pisa.
This work has been produced together with my friends and colleagues during our last year of Bachelor, to whom I am immensely grateful for all our long discussions and for this grat opportunity.

The authors:
Valerio Caporioni
Davide Chiego 
Alessandro Gori
Marco Pompili

Last but not least, we all thank our lecturers Prof. Ettore Vicari and Prof. Vincenzo Alba for their work and inspiration.
