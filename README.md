Some lecture notes on Quantum Mechanics written in Italian

These notes are based on a course in Quantum Mechanics held at the University of Pisa over the course of two semesters.
This work has been realised together with my friends and colleagues of my Bachelor's degree, to whom I am immensely grateful for all our long discussions and for this great opportunity.

The authors:
Valerio Caporioni,
Davide Chiego, 
Alessandro Gori,
Marco Pompili

Last but not least, we all thank our lecturers Prof. Ettore Vicari and Prof. Vincenzo Alba for their work and inspiration.
